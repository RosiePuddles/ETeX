# ETeX
ETeX is a python library that creates a simpler and more user friendly interface with LaTeX. It is still currently in development and so will inevitably have issues. These can be seen on the [issues page](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/LaTeX_from_python/issues). All of the projects, current and future, can be viewed on the [project page](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/LaTeX_from_python/projects).
