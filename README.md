# ETeX
ETeX is a python library that creates a simpler and more user friendly interface with LaTeX. It is still currently in development and so will inevitably have issues. These can be seen on the [issues page](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/LaTeX_from_python/issues). All of the projects, current and future, can be viewed on the [project page](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/LaTeX_from_python/projects).
## Docs
For full documentation please [read the docs](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/ETeX/blob/master/ETeX%20Documentation.pdf). The code used to create the documentation file is also available to look through if you want to have a look at a lot of examles of the package being used throughout the document. Most parts of the package are avaiable to view in the documentation.
For more detailed examples, please wait until I have the time to make them, after which they will be available in the `examples` folder of this repo.
Okay enjoy x
